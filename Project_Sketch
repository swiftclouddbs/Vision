Our goal is a system to determine if files contain useful info.  We will do this by having
llava look at pie charts of datasets and determine if they are useful or not.


Useful for pie_top_five and graph_bar+pie

SELECT IP, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Aug24_Windows
GROUP BY IP
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;


Project Goal:
We want the system to create pie charts for D&D datasets. -> DONE!!
Output a jpeg graph with file name included
Collect a group these and have llava exmaine the images:
	Which image has the greatest percentage of IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	Which image has the least percentage of IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	Which image(s) have data on IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


Sample Databases:
Name		Tables
Level_Four	Sept24		test frq. by IP
		Aug24_Win  	test frq. by IP
		Aug24_Linux  	test frq. by IP

Level_Five	Sept24		test frq. by IP
		Aug24_Win   	test frq. by IP
		Aug24_Linux  	test frq. by IP

See tables in database, using sql submission form, enter DB name &:

SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE type = 'table';


Milestone:  We have loaded the data and charts are being generated.  Need to alter
code so charts are lable with relevant data and saved to jpeg.  ->   DONE!!

To create pie charts:

Type in database name

SELECT IP, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Sept_24
GROUP BY IP
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;


We now have a set of jpeg files.  10.21.41.82 is a promient IP.
	ID files where 10.21.41.82 appears
	ID file where you see 10.21.41
	In the file, what percent of the graph belongs to 10.21.66.163? (L5_Sept24)
